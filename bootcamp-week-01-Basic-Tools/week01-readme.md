# 🧬 Week 1: Basic Tools for Bioinformatics and Reproducible Research

Welcome to **Week 1** of our Computational Biology Bootcamp!  
This module introduces essential tools and concepts for **bioinformatics research**, **collaborative science**, and **reproducible workflows**.

---

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains learning resources and guides on the following:

- ✅ **Python and R Installation**
- ✅ **Jupyter Notebooks (Google Colab)**
- ✅ **Git & GitHub**
- ✅ **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Genomac-ihub/COMPUTATIONAL-BIOLOGY-C2.git
cd bootcamp-week-01-Basic-Tools
```
### OR (if you have SSH setup - often much faster than HTTP. More on this later!!!)
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Genomac-ihub/COMPUTATIONAL-BIOLOGY-C2.git
```

### 2. Open Guides

You can read the PDF guides using your favorite PDF reader, or directly from the GitHub interface.

### 3. Try Google Colab

Use the provided notebook or create your own:

- Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
- Click **File > Upload notebook** or paste the GitHub URL to open

## 📌 Assignment – Week 1

🎯 **Goal**: Demonstrate that you have successfully installed the required tools.

### ✅ Instructions

1. Take **screenshots** of the successful installation for:
   - Miniconda
   - Git/Github
   - Visual Studio Code
   - WSL or Linux (if applicable)
   - Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab access

2. Combine these screenshots into a **single PDF file**

3. **Name the file exactly** as:

```
Assignment-week1-done.pdf
```

4. Create a **new Git branch** using your name or GitHub username:

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

5. Add and commit the file:

```bash
git add Assignment-week1-done.pdf
git commit -m "Add Week 1 assignment"
git push origin your-branch-name
```

6. (Optional) Create a **pull request** from your branch to share your submission.

> 📌 Submitting this assignment via Git helps you practice **version control**, **branching**, and **pushing files to GitHub**—core skills for bioinformatics collaboration.
